.. _stream_command_client:

Remote streaming (command line client)
=======================================

When using the remote streaming option, the data is streamed to a remote computer over the network. This option is useful for applications where the necessary data processing exceeds the capabilities of the Red Pitaya board and must therefore be done with more powerful tools on a remote computer.
Streaming through the command line client is the most effective way to transfer the data, allowing for the highest possible data transfer rate.

The command line client is available for Windows and Linux operating systems and supports :ref:`Multiboard streaming <multiboard_stream>`.

Instructions for the rpsa_client
-----------------------------------

1. **Detect mode**

    This mode allows you to determine the IP addresses that are in the local network in streaming mode. By default, the search takes about 5 seconds.

   	.. literalinclude:: ../include/detectMode.txt

    If no IP is specified, the client will automatically detect boards on the network and connect to a random board.

2. **Configuration mode**

    This mode allows you to get or set the streaming configuration on the boards.

   	.. literalinclude:: ../include/configMode.txt

    Variables can also be set individually:

    .. literalinclude:: ../include/configModeSingle.txt

3. **Remote control mode**
      
    This mode allows you to control streaming as a client.

   	.. literalinclude:: ../include/remoteControlMode.txt

4. **Streaming mode**

    This mode allows you to control streaming as a client, and also captures data in network streaming mode.

    .. literalinclude:: ../include/streamingMode.txt

5. **DAC streaming mode**

    This mode allows you to generate output data using a signal from a file.

    .. literalinclude:: ../include/dacStreamingMode.txt

6. **Configuration variables**

    Configuration file variables and their valid values.

    .. literalinclude:: ../include/configVariables.txt


.. note::

    If you run the console client with no parameters, the help menu will open, displaying a list of settings and their respective acceptable values.


The configuration file is located in the same folder as the client application. The file is named **config_<board_IP>.json** and contains the current settings of the streaming application. The file is created after the first configuration file request.


.. _streaming_convert_tool:

Convert tool
--------------

.. tabs::

    .. group-tab:: OS 2.07-43 or newer

        The convert tool allows you to convert the *.bin* file format into a *.csv*, *.tdms*, or *.wav* file.

        .. literalinclude:: ../include/convert_tool.txt

        To convert the binary file, first check the file information using:

        .. code-block:: bash

            .\convert_tool.exe .\<path_to_bin_file>\data_file.bin -i

        .. literalinclude:: ../include/convert_tool_info.txt

        The file information includes the number of segments into which the data is split. Using the convert tool, you can choose to convert only the specfied portion of the streamed file to the desired forma

        .. code-block:: bash

            .\convert_tool.exe .\<path_to_bin_file>\data_file.bin -s 1 -e 18 -f CSV

        The converted file will appear next to the original file.

        .. note::

            The file type (CSV, TDMS or WAV) must be capitalised.
