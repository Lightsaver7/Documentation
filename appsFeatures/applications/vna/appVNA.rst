.. note::

    The VNA application is a 3rd party application created and maintained by Pavel Demin and the SDR community. The application in the official Red Pitaya OS is ported from the community Alpine Linux image.
    For the access to the latest community updates, please check the |red_pitaya_notes_vna|.

********************************
What do I need before I start?
********************************

1. VNA application requirements:

    *   Windows or Linux-based personal computer (PC).

2. The following accessories and materials are available in the Red Pitaya store:

    *   any kit that includes a STEMlab 125-14, SDRlab 122-16, or 125-10 (discontinued) board
    *   Vector Network Analyzer bridge module

*****************************************************
Start using Red Pitaya as a Vector Network Analyser
*****************************************************

Connect Vector Network Analyzer bridge to the Red Pitaya
========================================================

    *   Connect the VNA module's OUT to the Red Pitaya IN1

Perform calibration and start measuring
***************************************

.. note::

   On SDRlab 122-16 the VNA module works for frequencies above 500 kHz. Please start the calibration process at 500 kHz (ignore calibration values in the pictrures).

Examples:
=========

#. Measurement of a 21-meter vertical antenna
    The antenna is not properly tuned (at frequency 14, 21 MHz, SWR should be = 1.5).

        :width: 600

#. 20-meter bandpass filter for HAM RADIO
    SWR is better than 1.5 between the start and stop band frequencies, and the filter load is around 50 Ohm.
