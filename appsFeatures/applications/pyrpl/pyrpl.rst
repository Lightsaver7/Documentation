The application is based on the `official PyRPL GitHub repository <https://github.com/pyrpl-fpga/pyrpl>`_ developed by Leonard Neuhaus

For more information, see the `official documentation <https://pyrpl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.


What do I need before I start?
==============================

1. PyPRL application requirements:

    * Windows, MacOS (arm64 for pre-built app) or Linux-based personal computer (PC).

2. The application is designed for Red Pitaya board models:

    * **STEMlab 125-14**
    * **STEMlab 125-14 Low Noise**
    * **STEMlab 125-14 External clock**
    * **STEMlab 125-14 Z7020**
    * **STEMlab 125-10 (discontinued)** (not confirmed but should work)

..  note::

    The PyRPL will not work on **SDRlab 122-16** and **SIGNALlab 250-12**.


Install & run PyRPL
===================

There are two ways to run the application:

    * Download the `pre-built application <https://downloads.redpitaya.com/downloads/Clients/pyrpl/>`_ for the appropriate platform.
    * Run source code from the repository: `rp_pyrpl_github <https://github.com/RedPitaya/pyrpl>`_.

We recommend using the latest community version as it is continuously improving.
