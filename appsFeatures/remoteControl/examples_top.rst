In the list below, you will find examples of how to control Red Pitaya remotely through SCPI commands, as well as with onboard C and Python API commands. JupyterLab also falls into the second category. These examples cover all basic Red Pitaya functionalities, such as:

    * Signal generation.
    * Signal acquisition.
    * Deep memory acquisition.
    * Digital I/O control.
    * Communication protocols.

You can edit and change them according to your needs and develop customized programs and routines.
