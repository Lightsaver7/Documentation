## April 2025 - Update 1

**Major updates:**

- Partial Gen 2 board documentation added.
- E3 add-on module documentation added.
- Added E3 I2C controller and ecosystem updater command line utilities.
- Reorganized the prepare SD card section to be more user-friendly and added instructions for installing Nightly builds.

- 4-Input external reference clock option added.

**Minor updates:**

- Reorganized the FAQ section and added a common troubleshooting guide.
- Updated and fixed internal links.
- Playback and record docs update.
- Updated command line utilities.
- Reorganized the API and SCPI command structure (advancing towards a separate page for each command).
- Removed Scilab from SCPI command list (the command structure is similar to MATLAB).
- Fixed a mistake in FPGA pin number labelling of the I2C pins for Gen 1 boards - the pin description was correct, but the pin numbering was switched.
- Moved pictures into img folders.
- Ate one Red Pitaya fruit (it was delicious).
- Removed title numbering for level 4 and higher titles.
- Added index links to the registers.

**Broken links:**

- Links to all Red Pitaya board docs - specific boards, jumpers, extension connectors, etc. (separated into Gen 1 and Gen 2 boards) including extension module links (click shield, etc.). Will try to relink all old links to the gen 1 hardware documentation page.
- Links to specific command line tools (acquire, generate, monitor) (moved into a separete directory).
- Links to specific SCPI commands on the command list (command list broken into separate pages).
- Links to specific system tools (moved into a separate directory).
- Quickstart connect (types of connections) (moved under the network manager section).

## February 2025 - Update 1

**Major updates:**

- Playback and record application.
- Updated Logic analyzer application docs.
- Added docs on SDR apps.
- Fixed and updated MATLAB example code.
- Added new examples for acquisition (split trigger).
- Fixed I2C, SPI and UART examples.
- New examples:

  - Split trigger acquisition.
  - Logic Analyzer decoding examples.

- Added new commands to the command list.
- Documented new software bugs.

**Minor updates:**

- Moved the obsolete HAMlab and power SDR to hardware => extension platforms and linked old HAMlab docs.
- Clarified modification instructions for external clock.
- Additional notes on 3rd party apps to marketplace.
- Updated PyRPL application docs.
- Author note added to VNA.
- Updated external clock requirements.
- Updated library section in C&Python API.
- Added required hardware and software notes to examples.
- Expanded the FAQ section.
- Grammar fixes and minor bug fixes.

**Links affected:**

- Specific code examples as I have changed the names of example files to sync them with the headings and make the file names readable. Links to examples top and e.g. acquisition examples top are unaffected.
- SDR application (old HAMlab docs) as I have moved it elsewhere
